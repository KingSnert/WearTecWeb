<p>The hook: “sew” what?
1. Tell students they are going to watch a video that has components of wearable technologies. You want them to watch for:
■  Elements that make the wearable technology work.
■  The problem that was solved with this wear- able technology.
2.Watch the video.

3.Discuss: The most important question to answer is:
“What problem do you think the wearable solved?”
This begins the foundation of the engineering de- sign process: “identifying a problem.” In addition
to answering the question above discuss elements
that make the turn signal jacket work.
■  Describe to a partner the project you just saw.
■  What elements/parts did the wearable use?
(Power, button, switch lights, connections,
thread, conductor, user input, etc.)
■  What problem do you think the wearable
solved?
■  Explain to the participants that this video is
the big idea. They will be learning what makes projects like these work. During WearTec they won’t make this jacket, but will have the nec- essary skills to plan and build a similar jacket by the end of the program.</p>

Activity 1: A bow
For this activity you (the instructor) will be guiding the students through the EDP steps. This is intend- ed to be a guided example for the students. You will be doing a guided think-aloud to help students see the process of engineering design. You will also be encouraging students to re ect on this pro- cess at the end of the activity.
The students will record each step of the EDP.
Say: “We are going to use the engineer design pro- cess to solve a problem. We start by identifying the problem, constraints or goals of an issue.”
The Problem
We’ve been invited to a party with Beyoncé and Lil’ Wayne. The invitation says they are having a ‘light-up bow’ party. A light up bow is mandatory for admission. The party is tonight!!!
Identify problem, constraints and objec- tives
We need something:
■ 
Small (it’s a bow)
■ Can be worn: i.e. hair bow, bow-tie, acces-
sory, shoes, etc
Generate ideas/possible solutions
Ask Students: “What could we use to make
a bow?”
Have students write down some ideas, or jot ideas on a display (board, presentation pad, etc.) light bulb, cloth bow tie, wires...
After exploring the house, you found 1) LED’s, 2) card stock, 3) coin-cell batteries.
Back to Identify Problem: We return to this step, because we now have constraints of materials that we have on hand. This is important to tell students. By moving from back and forth between steps, you are illustrating the  uid nature of the engineering design process. This exempli es ‘iteration.’
