<p>The hook: “sew” what?
1. Tell students they are going to watch a video that has components of wearable technologies. You want them to watch for:
■  Elements that make the wearable technology work.
■  The problem that was solved with this wear- able technology.
2.Watch the video.

3.Discuss: The most important question to answer is:
“What problem do you think the wearable solved?”
This begins the foundation of the engineering de- sign process: “identifying a problem.” In addition
to answering the question above discuss elements
that make the turn signal jacket work.
■  Describe to a partner the project you just saw.
■  What elements/parts did the wearable use?
(Power, button, switch lights, connections,
thread, conductor, user input, etc.)
■  What problem do you think the wearable
solved?
■  Explain to the participants that this video is
the big idea. They will be learning what makes projects like these work. During WearTec they won’t make this jacket, but will have the nec- essary skills to plan and build a similar jacket by the end of the program.  </body></p>
